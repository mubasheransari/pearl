          <section className={styles.section}>
            <h2>1. Ensuring Structural Safety and Stability</h2>
            <p>
              A structural engineer assesses and designs buildings to ensure they can withstand load-bearing requirements,
              environmental factors, and long-term wear and tear. They help prevent foundation issues, structural failures, and
              potential hazards that could compromise safety.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className={styles.section}>
            <h2>2. Compliance with Local Building Regulations</h2>
            <p>
              Every region has specific building regulations and planning requirements. A local structural engineer is well-versed
              in local laws, zoning restrictions, and construction codes, ensuring that your project meets legal requirements and
              passes inspections without delays.
            </p>

          <section className={styles.section}>
            <h2>3. Expert Assessment for Renovations and Extensions</h2>
            <p>
              If you're planning to modify an existing structure, a <Link href="./structure-engineers" >structural engineer near me</Link> can evaluate the current foundation,
              walls, and load-bearing elements. They will determine whether reinforcements or design changes are necessary to
              maintain structural integrity.
            </p>

          <section className={styles.section}>
            <h2>4. Cost-Effective Engineering Solutions</h2>
            <p>
              Hiring a local structural engineer can save you money in the long run by identifying potential issues early and
              providing cost-effective solutions. They can optimize material usage, recommend energy-efficient designs, and prevent
              expensive rework.

          <section className={styles.section}>
            <h2>5. Risk Mitigation for Complex Projects</h2>
            <p>
              For complex construction projects, a structural engineer performs risk assessments, soil evaluations, and load
              calculations to ensure that the design can withstand environmental conditions such as wind, seismic activity, and
              heavy loads.

          <section className={styles.section}>
            <h2>6. Assistance with Planning Permission and Approvals</h2>
            <p>
              Structural engineers prepare technical reports and calculations required for planning permission and building control
              approvals. Their expertise ensures that your project complies with safety regulations and is approved without
              unnecessary delays.

            <h2>7. Structural Inspections for Property Buyers</h2>
            <p>
              If you're purchasing a property, a  <Link href="./structural-integrity-through-meticulous-structural-engineer-calculations-the-pepp-approach" >structural engineer near me</Link> can conduct a structural survey to check for foundation
              problems, cracks, or weaknesses. This helps buyers make informed decisions and negotiate repairs if needed.
