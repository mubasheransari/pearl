        <h2>A Spectrum of Calculation-Driven Services</h2>
        <p>
          PEPP offers a comprehensive suite of structural engineering services, each relying on rigorous structural engineer calculations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Load Analysis and Distribution</h4>
            <p>
              We perform in-depth load assessments to ensure structures can handle diverse loads, from everyday use (live loads) to environmental forces (wind, seismic). Our structural engineer calculations are critical for this crucial step.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Foundation Design</h4>
            <p>
            We perform in-depth load assessments to ensure structures can handle diverse loads, from everyday use (live loads) to environmental forces (wind, seismic). Our structural engineer calculations are critical for this crucial step.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Beam and Column Calculations</h4>
            <p>
            We provide accurate structural engineer calculations for beams and columns to ensure they can safely support applied loads. This encompasses steel beam designs (BS EN 1993 compliant), concrete beam and column designs (BS EN 1992 compliant), and timber beam and joist calculations aligned with BS EN 1995
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Retaining Wall Design</h4>
            <p>
            Our structural engineer calculations ensure retaining walls can handle lateral earth pressures, water loads, and surcharge forces. We design cantilever and reinforced masonry walls compliant with BS EN 1996.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Roof and Floor Systems</h4>
            <p>
            Structural engineer calculations ensure roofs and floors are optimized for strength and safety. This includes truss designs for pitched and flat roofs, and floor joist and slab designs to accommodate live and dead loads.
            </p>
          </li>
         
          <li>
            <h4>Temporary Works Calculations</h4>
            <p>
            Structural engineer calculations ensure roofs and floors are optimized for strength and safety. This includes truss designs for pitched and flat roofs, and floor joist and slab designs to accommodate live and dead loads.
