            <ul className={styles.list}>
              <li>
                <strong>Project Complexity</strong> – Simple assessments cost significantly less than
                complex commercial, industrial, or infrastructure projects requiring in-depth engineering
                solutions and risk analysis.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Scope of Services</strong> – Fees vary based on whether you need feasibility studies,

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Sector-Specific Requirements</strong> – The costs for residential, commercial, and
                public infrastructure consultancy differ due to varying compliance needs, safety regulations,
                and material specifications.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Planning & Regulatory Compliance</strong> – If the project involves planning permissions,

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Urgency & Timelines</strong> – Expedited consultancy services or urgent project approvals

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Technology & Sustainability Solutions</strong> – If the project requires sustainable design
