          <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>1. Search for Locally Experienced Structural Engineers</h2>
          <p className={styles.text}>
            When looking for a <Link href="/structural_enigneering_services" className={styles.link}>structural engineer near me</Link>, prioritize those with experience in local building regulations, planning laws, and environmental conditions.

          <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>2. Verify Qualifications and Certifications</h2>
          <p className={styles.text}>
            A reputable structural engineer should hold credentials from recognized institutions, such as:
          </p>
          <ul className={styles.list}>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>Institution of Structural Engineers (IStructE)</li>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE)</li>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>Chartered Engineer (CEng) status</li>

        <section className={styles.section}>
          <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>3. Review Their Portfolio and Client Feedback</h2>
          <p className={styles.text}>
            Before making a decision, ask for a portfolio of completed projects and read client testimonials. A well-established structural engineer should have experience in residential, commercial, or industrial projects and be able to provide references.
