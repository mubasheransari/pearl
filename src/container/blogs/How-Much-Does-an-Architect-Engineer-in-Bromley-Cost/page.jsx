            <h2>1. Key Factors Influencing Architect Engineer Costs in Bromley</h2>
            <p>The cost of hiring an architect engineer depends on several critical factors, including:</p>
            <ul className={styles.list}>
              <li>
                <strong>Project Complexity –</strong> A simple home extension costs significantly less than a full-scale
                commercial or industrial project, which requires detailed structural calculations and advanced
                engineering.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Scope of Services –</strong> The cost varies based on whether you need conceptual design, full
                architectural drawings, structural calculations, or project management.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Property Type –</strong> Residential properties typically require less engineering work compared to
                heritage buildings, commercial spaces, or high-rise developments.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Regulatory Compliance –</strong> Projects that require planning permissions, structural approvals,
                and compliance with UK Building Regulations involve additional fees.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Urgency and Timelines –</strong> Expedited services often come with higher costs, especially for
                urgent assessments or planning submissions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Technology and Materials Used –</strong> The incorporation of sustainable building materials, smart
                design solutions, and energy-efficient layouts can also impact costs.
              </li>
            </ul>
