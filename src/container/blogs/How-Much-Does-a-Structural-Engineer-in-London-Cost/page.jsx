            <h2>1. Factors Affecting the Cost of a Structural Engineer</h2>
            <p>Several elements impact the cost of hiring a structural engineer in London:</p>
            <ul className={styles.list}>
              <li>
                <strong>Project Complexity:</strong> More intricate projects, such as loft conversions, basement
                extensions, or load-bearing wall removals, require detailed structural calculations and may be more
                expensive.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Property Type:</strong> Engineering fees can differ for residential, commercial, and industrial
                properties due to variations in regulations and design requirements.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Site Inspections and Surveys:</strong> A structural inspection report or structural survey is
                often required to assess safety concerns, which can affect pricing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Planning and Compliance:</strong> If the project involves planning permission, Building Control
                approval, or adherence to UK Building Regulations, additional engineering work may be necessary,
                increasing costs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Urgency of Service:</strong> Fast-track or emergency structural assessments may incur additional
                charges.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>
