            <h2>1. Preventing Expensive Structural Failures</h2>
            <p>
              A structural engineer assesses building integrity before construction, preventing critical issues like foundation settlement, 
              weak load-bearing walls, and improper material usage. Early detection helps avoid costly repairs and legal issues.

          <section className={styles.section}>
            <h2>2. Optimizing Material Usage</h2>
            <p>
              Using wrong materials or over-reinforcing leads to unnecessary expenses. A structural engineer determines optimal materials 
              and designs, ensuring cost-effective solutions without compromising safety.
            </p>

          <section className={styles.section}>
            <h2>3. Ensuring Compliance with Building Codes</h2>
            <p>
              Failing to meet regulations can result in fines and delays. A  <Link href="/structural_enigneering_services">structural engineer near me</Link> ensures all designs adhere to 
              local building codes, avoiding costly rework.

          <section className={styles.section}>
            <h2>5. Avoiding Unnecessary Renovations</h2>
            <p>
