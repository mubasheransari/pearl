        <h2>What Sets PEPP Apart?</h2>
        <div>
          <div>
            <h3>Technical Excellence</h3>
            <p>
              Our team’s knowledge and experience go beyond surface-level solutions. Every project is rooted in sound technical principles and compliance with key standards, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                British Standards (BS) such as BS EN 1993 for steel structures and BS EN 1992 for concrete design.
              </li>
              <li>
                Building Regulations Approved Documents, including Part A (Structure), Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Power), and Part M (Access to and Use of Buildings).
              </li>
              <li>
                Guidance from RIBA and ARB to ensure designs are both innovative and compliant.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We focus on delivering designs and plans that stand up to scrutiny, providing clients with confidence in their projects' long-term success.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Efficient and Transparent Pricing</h3>
            <p>
              Many firms in the design services UK and engineering space rely heavily on advertising to attract clients, often passing <Link href='https://shorturl.at/cxwO4'>architectural design services UK</Link> on these costs through higher service fees. At PEPP, we believe in keeping costs competitive by focusing on what matters most: delivering exceptional results. Our streamlined operations allow us to offer affordable services while maintaining a sharp focus on quality and compliance.
            </p>

        <div>
          <div>
            <h3>Client-Centric Approach</h3>
            <p>
              Every project we take on is unique, and we treat it as such. Instead of templated solutions, we provide tailored recommendations that consider the specific needs of your project. Whether it’s navigating complex planning submissions or designing sustainable structures, our clients can rely on us for guidance rooted in technical depth and industry know-how.
