          <h2>1. Understanding Planning Permission</h2>
          <p>
            Planning permission refers to the legal approval required from local authorities before commencing certain types of construction. It ensures that the project aligns with local planning policies, environmental considerations, and community impact.
          </p>
          
          <h3>When Do You Need Planning Permission?</h3>
          <ul className={styles.list}>
            <li>New builds and large extensions exceeding size limits.</li>
            <li>Loft conversions or basement renovations that significantly alter the structure.</li>
            <li>Changing building use, such as converting a residential property into a commercial space.</li>
            <li>Properties in conservation areas where design restrictions apply.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>What Happens If You Don't Get Planning Permission?</h3>
          <p>
            Failure to obtain planning approval can result in enforcement action, fines, or even demolition orders.
          </p>

          <h2>2. What Is Building Control?</h2>
          <p>
            Building control ensures that construction work complies with UK Building Regulations. Unlike planning permission, which focuses on the design and aesthetics, building control is concerned with safety, accessibility, and energy efficiency.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Key Aspects of Building Control:</h3>
          <ul className={styles.list}>
            <li>Structural stability to prevent risks such as subsidence or collapse.</li>
            <li>Fire safety regulations, including fire doors and escape routes.</li>
            <li>Energy efficiency through proper insulation and ventilation.</li>
            <li>Drainage, plumbing, and electrical compliance for a safe and functional home.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className={styles.blogSection}>
          <h2>3. How Planning and Building Control Work Together</h2>
          <p>
            Both processes ensure that construction projects meet national and local standards. A project may require:
          </p>
          <ul className={styles.list}>
            <li>Planning permission only (for minor external changes).</li>
            <li>Building control approval only (for internal structural modifications).</li>
            <li>Both approvals (for major renovations, extensions, or new builds).</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className={styles.blogSection}>
          <h2>4. Do You Need a Structural Engineer for Planning and Building Control?</h2>
          <p>
            A structural engineer is essential for projects requiring load-bearing calculations, foundation designs, and safety evaluations. Their expertise ensures that your plans meet regulatory requirements and pass inspections by building control officers.
