        <h2>Comprehensive Structural Calculations Services</h2>
        <p>At PEPP, our expertise spans all aspects of <Link href='/structural_enigneering_services'>structural calculations</Link>, ensuring that every design is robust, efficient, and fully compliant.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Load Assessments</h4>
            <p>
              We analyze all forces acting on a structure, including live, dead, wind, and seismic loads, to ensure stability. Our structural calculations guarantee that every part of the structure can withstand these forces, providing safety and durability.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Foundation Design Calculations</h4>
            <div>
            The foundation is critical to the stability of any structure. Our structural calculations for foundations include:
            <ul>
            <li>Shallow foundations (strip, pad, and raft foundations), designed in line with BS EN 1997 (Geotechnical Design).</li>
            <li>Deep foundations (pile and pile cap designs) for challenging soil conditions.</li>
            <li>Customized solutions for underpinning and resolving subsidence issues.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Beam and Column Calculations</h4>
            <div>
            Our structural calculations for beams and columns ensure they can carry applied loads safely, adhering to:
            <ul>
            <li>BS EN 1993 (Steel Structures) for steel beams and connections.</li>
            <li>BS EN 1992 (Concrete Structures) for reinforced concrete elements.</li>
            <li>BS EN 1995 (Timber Structures) for residential and bespoke timber projects.</li>
