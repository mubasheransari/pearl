              When planning a <Link href="/project_management" >construction project in London</Link> it’s essential to understand the difference between a
              structural engineer and an architect. While both professionals play critical roles in the design and
              construction process, their responsibilities and expertise vary significantly. Knowing who to hire can save
              time, reduce costs, and ensure regulatory compliance. Let’s explore the key differences between a structural
              engineer and an architect, and when you need each professional.

            <h2>1. What Does a Structural Engineer Do?</h2>
            <p>A structural engineer focuses on the strength, stability, and safety of buildings and structures. Their responsibilities include:</p>
            <ul className={styles.list}>
              <li>Structural calculations to ensure buildings can withstand loads and forces.</li>
              <li>Foundation and beam assessments to maintain structural integrity.</li>
              <li>Load-bearing wall modifications to prevent collapses.</li>
              <li>Subsidence and foundation inspections to detect potential structural risks.</li>
              <li>Ensuring compliance with UK Building Regulations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Structural engineers work closely with architects and contractors to ensure that designs are not only
              aesthetically pleasing but also safe and structurally sound.

            <h2>2. What Does an Architect Do?</h2>
            <p>An architect is responsible for the design, aesthetics, and functionality of a building. Their tasks include:</p>
            <ul className={styles.list}>
              <li>Creating architectural drawings and blueprints.</li>
              <li>Optimizing space and layout for functionality and aesthetics.</li>
              <li>Planning permissions and building regulations compliance.</li>
              <li>Material selection for energy efficiency and sustainability.</li>
              <li>Overseeing design execution to match the client’s vision.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Architects focus on the visual and functional aspects of a project, ensuring it aligns with the client's
              needs and regulatory requirements.

            <h2>5. Do You Need Both an Architect and a Structural Engineer?</h2>
            <p>
              For large-scale projects, you often need both professionals. An architect will focus on the design and
              planning, while a structural engineer ensures that the design is structurally viable and safe. Working
              together, they ensure a seamless, compliant, and efficient building process.
