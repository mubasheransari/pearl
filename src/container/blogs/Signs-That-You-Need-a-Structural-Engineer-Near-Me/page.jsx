              A <Link href="/structural_enigneering_services" className={styles.link1}>structural engineer near me</Link> plays a vital role in assessing the integrity, safety, and stability of

          <section className={styles.section}>
            <h2>1. Cracks in Walls, Ceilings, or Foundations</h2>
            <p>
              If you notice large or widening cracks in walls, ceilings, or foundations, it could indicate structural
              movement or foundation settlement. A structural engineer can assess the severity and recommend the necessary
              repairs or reinforcements.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className={styles.section}>
            <h2>2. Uneven or Sagging Floors</h2>
            <p>
              Uneven or sagging floors could be a result of foundation issues, rotting support beams, or structural
              instability. A professional evaluation by a structural engineer near me will help determine the cause and
              suggest corrective actions.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className={styles.section}>
            <h2>3. Doors and Windows Not Closing Properly</h2>
            <p>
              If doors and windows stick, jam, or do not close properly, it might be due to foundation shifts, warping, or
              settling. A structural engineer can inspect whether this is a normal occurrence or a sign of a deeper
              structural issue.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className={styles.section}>
            <h2>4. Visible Structural Damage After a Natural Disaster</h2>
            <p>
              Following storms, earthquakes, or floods, buildings may suffer hidden or visible damage. A structural
              engineer can assess load-bearing walls, roofing, and foundations to ensure the structure remains safe.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className={styles.section}>
            <h2>5. Planning a Major Renovation or Extension</h2>
            <p>
              If you are considering removing load-bearing walls, adding a new floor, or expanding your home, hiring a
              structural engineer ensures that the modifications comply with building codes and safety standards.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className={styles.section}>
            <h2>6. Signs of Foundation Movement</h2>
            <p>
              Indicators of foundation movement include gaps between walls and floors, sloping floors, and exterior
              cracks. A structural engineer can determine whether the foundation needs reinforcement or repair.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className={styles.section}>
            <h2>7. Leaning or Bowing Walls</h2>
            <p>
              Walls that lean, bow, or bulge may be experiencing excessive pressure from soil movement, moisture intrusion,
              or structural failure. A <Link href="/structure-engineers" className={styles.link1}>structural engineer near me</Link> will provide the necessary assessment and solutions.

          <section className={styles.section}>
            <h2>8. Preparing to Buy or Sell a Property</h2>
            <p>
              A structural inspection before purchasing or selling a property helps identify potential issues and provides
              assurance to buyers regarding the propertyâ€™s stability and integrity.
