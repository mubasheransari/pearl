        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>2. Experience and Expertise</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          The engineer’s experience should align with the type of project you are undertaking, whether it is residential, commercial, industrial, or historical preservation. Areas of expertise to look for include:
        </p>
        <ul className={styles.list}>
          <li>Load-bearing wall assessments</li>
          <li>Foundation design and stability analysis</li>
          <li>Loft conversions and basement extensions</li>
          <li>Structural inspections and surveys</li>
          <li>Compliance with UK Building Regulations</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section className={styles.section}>
        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>3. Regulatory Knowledge and Compliance</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          London has strict building regulations and safety standards. Your structural engineer should be well-versed in:
        </p>
        <ul className={styles.list}>
          <li>UK Building Regulations</li>
          <li>Local planning permissions</li>
          <li>Health and safety laws</li>
          <li>Building control approvals</li>
        </ul>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          Failure to comply with these regulations can lead to legal issues, project delays, and costly penalties.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className={styles.section}>
        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>4. Reputation and Client Reviews</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          Before hiring, check for:
        </p>
        <ul className={styles.list}>

          <li>Testimonials from previous clients</li>
          <li>Case studies of completed projects</li>

        </p>
      </section>

      <section className={styles.section}>
        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>5. Clear Communication and Transparency</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          Effective communication is essential. Your structural engineer should:
        </p>
        <ul className={styles.list}>
          <li>Clearly explain technical details in a way that’s easy to understand.</li>
          <li>Provide a structured plan for your project.</li>
          <li>Be transparent about pricing, timelines, and deliverables.</li>
          <li>Offer regular updates throughout the project lifecycle.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section className={styles.section}>
        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>6. Cost and Budget Considerations</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          Structural engineering fees vary based on project size, complexity, and required services. Get multiple quotes and ensure the estimate includes:
        </p>
        <ul className={styles.list}>
          <li>Structural calculations and reports</li>
          <li>Site inspections and assessments</li>
          <li>Permit and regulatory compliance fees</li>
          <li>Additional consultation services if needed</li>
        </ul>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          Avoid choosing a structural engineer based on price alone—expertise and reliability are far more important factors.
