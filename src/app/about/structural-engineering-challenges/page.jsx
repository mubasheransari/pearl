      <h1 className={styles.title}>Structural Engineering Challenges and Solutions in London</h1>
      <p className={styles.intro}>
        London's ever-evolving skyline and infrastructure projects present complex challenges for structural engineers. With an aging building stock, increasing population density, and environmental concerns, structural engineers must develop innovative solutions to ensure safety, sustainability, and regulatory compliance. Here are some of the most pressing structural engineering challenges in London and how they are being addressed.
      </p>

      <section className={styles.section}>
        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>1. Aging Infrastructure and Structural Deterioration</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          Many of London’s buildings and bridges date back centuries, leading to material degradation and structural weakening over time. Challenges include:
        </p>
        <ul className={styles.list}>
          <li>Corrosion of steel reinforcements in bridges and high-rises.</li>
          <li>Foundation settlement causing structural instability.</li>
          <li>Wear and tear on historical buildings, requiring delicate restoration techniques.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Structural engineers use advanced material testing, reinforcement techniques, and non-invasive restoration methods to maintain heritage buildings and modern infrastructure. Innovative solutions such as carbon fiber reinforcement and self-healing concrete help prolong the lifespan of aging structures.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className={styles.section}>
        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>2. High-Density Urban Construction Constraints</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          As space becomes scarce in London, the demand for high-rise developments and underground structures continues to grow. Challenges include:
        </p>
        <ul className={styles.list}>
          <li>Limited space for foundation excavation.</li>
          <li>Height and wind load considerations for skyscrapers.</li>
          <li>Impact on neighboring structures during construction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Engineers utilize deep foundation systems, wind-resistant structural designs, and tunneling technologies to optimize land use. Advanced modeling software helps predict structural interactions and mitigate risks during excavation and high-rise construction.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className={styles.section}>
        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>3. Climate Change and Environmental Impact</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          London is increasingly experiencing flooding, extreme temperatures, and urban heat island effects, putting stress on buildings and infrastructure. Challenges include:
        </p>
        <ul className={styles.list}>
          <li>Flood risks due to rising water levels and outdated drainage systems.</li>
          <li>Thermal expansion and contraction of materials leading to structural stress.</li>
          <li>Energy inefficiency in older buildings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Structural engineers integrate sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS), green roofs, and flood-resistant foundations into modern designs. The use of energy-efficient materials, smart insulation systems, and renewable energy solutions reduces environmental impact and enhances sustainability.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className={styles.section}>
        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>4. Regulatory and Compliance Challenges</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          London has strict building regulations and safety codes, requiring engineers to meet stringent planning approvals. Challenges include:
        </p>
        <ul className={styles.list}>
          <li>Complex approval processes for new developments.</li>
          <li>Adapting old structures to meet modern fire and safety regulations.</li>
          <li>Structural assessments for insurance and liability purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> By working with regulatory bodies and planning authorities, structural engineers ensure compliance with UK Building Regulations, fire safety laws, and environmental codes. Advanced BIM (Building Information Modeling) technology helps streamline compliance checks and improve project planning.
