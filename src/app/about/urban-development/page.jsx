        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>1. Ensuring Structural Safety and Compliance</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          Structural engineers design and analyze buildings to ensure they withstand environmental and load-bearing pressures. Their expertise extends beyond simple design calculations; they conduct material strength tests, foundation stability analyses, and advanced structural simulations to assess how buildings react under various stress conditions. They work closely with architects and contractors to meet UK Building Regulations, ensuring:
        </p>
        <ul className={styles.list}>
          <li>Seismic and wind resistance</li>
          <li>Fire and safety compliance</li>
          <li>Load-bearing calculations</li>
          <li>Risk assessments for material durability</li>
        </ul>

      <section className={styles.section}>
        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>2. Supporting Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Development</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          With London pushing for green construction, structural engineers play a crucial role in integrating sustainable materials and energy-efficient designs. They ensure that structures are designed with carbon footprint reduction in mind, incorporating innovative solutions to lower energy consumption and emissions. Some of the key elements include:
        </p>
        <ul className={styles.list}>
          <li>Low-carbon concrete and recycled steel to minimize resource depletion and waste.</li>
          <li>Passive solar design for energy conservation, which enhances natural heating and cooling methods to reduce reliance on artificial climate control.</li>
          <li>Green roofs and rainwater harvesting systems that improve insulation, manage stormwater runoff, and contribute to biodiversity.</li>
          <li>Modular construction techniques that allow for efficient material use and reduced on-site waste.</li>
          <li>Smart energy systems integrated into buildings, such as solar panels, automated lighting, and energy storage solutions.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section className={styles.section}>
        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>3. Facilitating Smart Infrastructure Growth</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          From bridges to tunnels and underground transit systems, structural engineers contribute to London’s expanding infrastructure. Their expertise ensures that public transport and road networks remain safe, durable, and efficient. They design structurally sound bridges, overpasses, and underground rail networks, ensuring long-term stability and minimal maintenance costs. By utilizing advanced materials and engineering techniques, they help London expand its transportation network while reducing environmental impact and improving sustainability.

        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>4. Preserving and Restoring Historical Buildings</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          London is home to centuries-old structures, requiring expert structural reinforcement, restoration, and adaptive reuse. Engineers ensure that historical sites retain their architectural heritage while meeting modern safety standards.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          The challenge of maintaining historical landmarks involves assessing existing load-bearing capacities, reinforcing aging materials, and implementing conservation-friendly construction techniques. Structural engineers work with heritage preservation specialists to use non-invasive strengthening methods, ensuring that historic buildings remain functional and safe without altering their original character.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          Additionally, engineers incorporate modern technologies like 3D laser scanning, digital structural modeling, and advanced material testing to evaluate and restore old structures with precision. Through careful planning, they ensure that historical buildings integrate seamlessly with modern infrastructure while maintaining their cultural and historical significance.

        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>5. Enhancing Urban Resilience Against Climate Change</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          Structural engineers incorporate flood-resistant foundations, storm-proofing measures, and wind-resistant designs to protect London’s urban fabric from extreme weather conditions. With the increasing impact of climate change, they are now developing sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) to manage rainwater effectively, preventing flooding in densely populated areas.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          Additionally, engineers integrate heat-resistant materials and cooling systems in new constructions to combat the effects of rising temperatures. They also use advanced predictive modeling to anticipate future climate risks and design structures accordingly, ensuring that buildings remain adaptable and resilient.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.sectionContent}>
          Through collaboration with environmental scientists, urban planners, and local governments, structural engineers contribute to climate action strategies, reinforcing the city’s ability to withstand environmental challenges while reducing carbon footprints in the long run.
