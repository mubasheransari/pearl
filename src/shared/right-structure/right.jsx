      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>1. Verify Qualifications and Certifications</h2>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        A professional structural design engineer in Bromley, London, UK should hold relevant qualifications, such as a degree in civil or structural engineering. They should also be registered with recognized institutions such as:
      </p>
      <ul className={styles.list}>
        <li>Institution of Structural Engineers (IStructE)</li>
        <li>Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE)</li>
        <li>Chartered Engineer (CEng) status</li>
      </ul>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        These accreditations indicate expertise and adherence to industry standards.
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>2. Assess Experience and Specialization</h2>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        Different projects require specific expertise. Look for an engineer with experience in your type of construction, whether it’s residential buildings, commercial properties, historical renovations, or large infrastructure projects. An experienced engineer can provide practical, cost-effective solutions tailored to your project’s needs.
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>3. Check Knowledge of Local Building Regulations</h2>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        Building projects in Bromley, London, UK must comply with planning and building control regulations. A knowledgeable engineer ensures your project meets safety requirements and avoids delays due to compliance issues.
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>4. Review Portfolio and Client Testimonials</h2>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        Ask potential engineers for a portfolio of completed projects and read client reviews to gauge their reliability and quality of work. A reputable structural engineer will have a track record of successful designs and satisfied clients.
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>5. Compare Costs and Services</h2>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        While cost is an important factor, it should not be the sole deciding factor. Compare quotes and services from different engineers, ensuring that you’re getting value for money rather than simply choosing the cheapest option.
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>6. Evaluate Communication and Problem-Solving Skills</h2>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        A good structural engineer should be able to communicate complex technical details in a clear and understandable manner. They should also be responsive to inquiries and demonstrate strong problem-solving skills to address unexpected challenges during construction.

We engaged Mohammed during a single storey extension project where the previous builder well and truly messed up the initial construction leading to council pointing out multiple problems which required rework. As this was part of a Building Control application, the council were closely involved. He did an exceptional job of not only providing the structural engineers report to be submitted to the council but also made architectural drawings and changes to accommodate the existing works, to avoid unnecessary redoing of work. He engaged well with the building inspector, the new builder and also managed to contact the council’s structural engineer who was vague in the comments and feedback. I particularly appreciated him making physical visits to address the concerns of the building inspectors and ensuring he works with us to understand our requirements and project budget.You will not regret hiring their services",

They are fast to communicate throughout the whole process, can set up a survey quickly, and can deliver a detailed and in-depth survey within a day. What I really appreciated was how Mojo took the time to answer questions especially after the survey uncovered some previously undetected issues, and we set up a post-survey call where he explained what kind of repairs would be required, and an estimate of the costs. My experience has been this is a company you can trust to provide you the answers you need and in my case has saved me from thousands of pounds in repair work, which in itself makes booking in the survey an extremely sound investment.",

All reports, drawings, explanations etc are super clear and complete to a very high standard. He is very thorough and clear in his approach and explanations, and always goes above and beyond to ensure the client gets the exactly what they’re after.  Very few businesses can give you enough confidence to re-engage their services however I can confidently say I will be returning for future projects!",

They went out of their way to accommodate us, answered all our questions, and worked with us to find cost-effective solutions. The aftercare was the best part—they were always just a phone call away. We had to make some changes to the design midway, and they handled it without any issues. They even helped us deal with building control questions and adjusted the design when we discovered unexpected changes after opening a wall. I really felt I had to write this review because their support was incredible. One thing I’d say is to follow their designs. Builders might have their own ideas, but even building control praised the plans, saying they were exactly how things should be done. Mojo, in particular, was super helpful. We worked with them on a structural design for removing a massive chimney breast. I am thankful to them for considering us in the centre of their design decision - For example, they suggested a splice in the beam, which saved us money with builders as we didn’t need a crane. If you want a team that knows what they’re doing and truly cares about their clients, Pearl Engineers Planners is the way to go!",

I was very impressed with level of knowledge and understanding that Mojo showed on the job. We hired Mojo for a structural survey of a house we were looking to buy for investment purposes. On surface everything looked perfect and we didn't think house had any issue. But Mojo highlighted some really important structural details which were critical to the structural integrity of the house and were very expensive to fix. His insight and knowledge saved us a great deal of money for which we are very thankful. We plan to hire Mojo for any future project we'll do and would highly recommend anyone for the same.",

I dealt with Mojo and to this day, I haven't come across any company or individual who where more accommodating than him. I was impressed when he came over for a site visit, on the same day that I called and enquired about their services. He came on site two more times when there were issues when we took out the chimney breast and the drawings had to be revised. He made the necessary changes without charging extra. What also was amazing about him, is the fact that he answered most questions I made through messages, in a matter of minutes. I never had to wait next day for a response. I have already recommended him to other friends who required his kind of services and will definitely contract him again in the future.",
