      <h1 className={styles.title}>Common Mistakes to Avoid When Hiring a Structural Design Engineer in Bromley, London</h1>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        Hiring the right structural design engineer in Bromley, London, UK is essential for ensuring the safety, efficiency, and compliance of your construction project. However, many property owners and developers make avoidable mistakes that can lead to delays, extra costs, and even legal issues. Below are the most common mistakes to avoid when choosing a structural engineer.
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>1. Not Checking Qualifications and Accreditation</h2>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        A qualified structural engineer should have relevant credentials from recognized bodies such as:
      </p>
      <ul className={styles.list}>
        <li>Institution of Structural Engineers (IStructE)</li>
        <li>Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE)</li>
        <li>Chartered Engineer (CEng) status</li>
      </ul>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        Failing to verify an engineer’s certifications and experience can lead to poor-quality work and compliance issues.
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>2. Choosing Based on Cost Alone</h2>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        While budgeting is important, selecting the cheapest structural engineer can be a costly mistake. Low-cost services often mean compromised quality, lack of thorough assessments, or incomplete reports. Always compare experience, expertise, and project success rates instead of just focusing on price.
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>3. Ignoring Local Experience and Knowledge</h2>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        Structural engineers must have detailed knowledge of local building regulations, planning laws, and environmental conditions in Bromley, London, UK. Engineers unfamiliar with local requirements may cause delays in approval processes or recommend unsuitable solutions for the area’s soil and weather conditions.
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>4. Not Reviewing Previous Work and Client Feedback</h2>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        Before hiring, always check an engineer’s portfolio of completed projects and read client reviews. A reputable engineer should provide references and showcase past work to demonstrate their ability to handle similar projects.
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>5. Overlooking Communication and Problem-Solving Skills</h2>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        A good structural engineer should be able to explain technical concepts in an understandable way. If an engineer is unresponsive, unclear, or unwilling to answer your questions, it may lead to misunderstandings, delays, and project setbacks.
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>6. Hiring Without a Clear Contract</h2>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        Never proceed without a formal agreement detailing the scope of work, timeline, fees, and deliverables. A written contract protects you from unexpected charges and disputes.
      </p>
