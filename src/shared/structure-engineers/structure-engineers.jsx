      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>1. Adhering to Building Regulations and Standards</h2>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Structural engineers must ensure that all projects comply with UK Building Regulations, local planning laws, and safety standards. This involves:
      </p>
      <ul className={styles.list}>
        <li>Conducting structural calculations to verify stability and load-bearing capacity.</li>
        <li>Ensuring fire safety, thermal performance, and accessibility requirements are met.</li>
        <li>Preparing reports for planning permission and building control approval.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>2. Structural Risk Assessments and Safety Inspections</h2>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Before and during construction, engineers perform structural risk assessments to identify and mitigate potential hazards. Key tasks include:
      </p>
      <ul className={styles.list}>
        <li>Site inspections to assess foundation conditions and material integrity.</li>
        <li>Evaluating wind loads, seismic resistance, and environmental impact.</li>
        <li>Detecting structural weaknesses that could lead to future failures.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>3. Reinforcing Foundations and Load-Bearing Structures</h2>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        A strong foundation is essential for any building. Structural engineers in Bromley, London, UK design reinforced foundations tailored to specific soil conditions. Techniques include:
      </p>
      <ul className={styles.list}>
        <li>Pile foundations for unstable or weak soil.</li>
        <li>Reinforced concrete slabs for better load distribution.</li>
        <li>Retrofitting older structures to enhance stability and longevity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>4. Ensuring Material Quality and Sustainability</h2>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        The choice of materials impacts structural strength, durability, and environmental sustainability. Engineers work with high-quality, sustainable materials such as:
      </p>
      <ul className={styles.list}>
        <li>Steel-reinforced concrete for resilience and longevity.</li>
        <li>Eco-friendly building materials like recycled steel and timber.</li>
        <li>Advanced composites that improve earthquake and weather resistance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>5. Compliance with Health and Safety Regulations</h2>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Structural engineers ensure construction sites comply with health and safety laws by:
      </p>
      <ul className={styles.list}>
        <li>Implementing safe working practices for contractors and laborers.</li>
        <li>Designing structures that reduce fire risks, collapses, and environmental hazards.</li>
        <li>Conducting post-construction safety inspections to verify compliance before occupancy.</li>
      </ul>
